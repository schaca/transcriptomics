This repository contains bash scripts for processing and analyzing RNA-seq data.

> Steps used for transcriptome assembly:

* Data QC with SolexaQA++
* Error correction using BFC
* Trimming reads using Trimmomatic
* Assembling reads using Trinity
* Translating contigs and gene predictions using Transdecoder
* Assembly QC using BUSCO and transrate


_The computations were performed on resources provided by
UNINETT Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and
Data Storage in Norway._
